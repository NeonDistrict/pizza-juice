# Pizza Juice Monorepo

A monorepo for the Neon District design system.

In the future, will be composed by the following packages:
  - utils
  - tsconfig
  - eslint
  - react
  - { ... all components ?}

In `/app` you'll find the `docs`, which is a live documentation of the design system, you can inspect the tokens, see example of usage, and try it out!

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
